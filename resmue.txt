Experience
Essentium, Inc. Austin, TX
Mechanical Engineer II March 2022 – July 2023
• Blue Laser DED Microwire Metal 3D Printer | DOD/AFRL R&D Contract
◦ Engineered over 200 components across three generations of Essentium’s R&D blue laser DED microwire metal 3D
printer, enabling the successful completion of multi-million dollar defense contract milestones
◦ Leveraged academic and industry research to solve unique challenges posed by metal wire printing, including needs
for precision extrusion, buffering, and in-line straightening of stainless steel and refractory microwire
◦ Served as the DRI for the printhead subsystem, collaborating with individual contributors and the systems engineer
to ensure that the printhead hit PRD specifications and effectively integrated with other subsystems
◦ Interfaced directly with local machine shops and large on-demand manufacturing service providers, supplying
detailed drawings and instructions that balanced part production speed, cost, and quality
◦ Designed, performed, and documented tests to validate the performance of engineered components and assemblies
◦ Machined prototype components in-house using standard machine shop tools (milling machine, lathe, etc.)
◦ Developed printing processes by designing experiments, performing tests, and analyzing data with custom scripts
◦ Curated the team’s SolidWorks PDM vault by designing a directory structure, updating top level assemblies,
encouraging proper check-in/check-out hygiene, and collaborating with the PDM administrator on technical issues
• HSE Polymer Printing Platform | Essentium Commercial Product
◦ Designed components across Essentium’s X80 polymer printing platform - including a flexible filament-focused hot
end and a remotely-viewable process camera - enabling key customers and internal users to develop new applications
and maintain heightened levels of process control
◦ Characterized the chamber heating performance of competitors’ 3D printers through application of DAQ and
programming knowledge, allowing Essentium to confidently define thermal requirements for its HSE 240 printer
• Additional Responsibilities
◦ Actively participated as a member of the Essentium Culture Committee, contributing to the development of a
positive work environment and implementing methods of improved visibility and accountability between teams
◦ Served as product owner and developer for Essentium’s next-gen HSE slicing software solution
◦ Organized, stocked, and maintained hardware, tools, and R&D machines in Essentium’s mechatronics laboratory
